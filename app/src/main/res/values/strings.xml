    <string name="about_title">About the Octagon Project</string>

    <string name="about_text">Dr. Gary Crossland is a Biblical Greek Professor, as well as an historian, author and documentary producer. For many years, he has been leading tours to the Holy Land, publishing videos about Israel, Jordan and Egypt, and guiding fellow scholars to rare and significant Biblical sites. In his journeys Dr. Crossland has literally retraced every recorded footstep of Jesus Christ, studying each site, and archiving thousands of hours of video footage.\n\n

It seems divinely providential that, from a young age, Gary Crossland would pursue a lifelong career doing what his last name so obviously denotes; that is, taking people to the land of the cross. Dr. Crossland spends about three months out of every year in Israel and Jordan, filming, teaching and leading tours.\n\n

He is also the author of The Merged Gospels – the only book in history to literally translate the four canonized Gospels from the original Greek, breaking them down into four columns, then word-by-word, and reassembling them into a flowing narrative, without removing one word of Scripture. Scholars have called The Merged Gospels “a masterpiece”, “excellent”, “indispensable”, “a major work”, “powerful and unique”, and “highly recommended”.\n\n

In our many travels to Israel, we have to come to realize that for every person who is fortunate enough to visit the Holy Land, there are hundreds of others who want to go, but cannot for various reasons – finances, health, mobility, scheduling, or family conflicts.\n\n

In 2012 we learned about the emerging technology of virtual reality (used mostly by gamers), and its younger sibling, augmented reality, which primarily uses 360° live-action video. Through the convergence of history, Biblical geography and this new immersive video technology The Octagon Project was born in 2013.\n\n

Today, The Octagon Project has grown into a team of highly-skilled video cameramen and technicians, specifically trained in the field of 360° full-spherical ultra-high-definition video production.\n\n

Using The Merged Gospels as a walking guide through the Holy Land, The Octagon Project crew has captured and produced countless hours of breathtaking 360° video in over 200 stunning locations. The entire project is the equivalent of a 30-day, expertly-guided tour to the Holy Land.\n\n

Our extended Octagon Project family includes a number of strategic partners, advisors, technicians and Israeli and Jordanian crew members.\n\n

The Octagon Project is a 501(c)(3) charitable corporation with our main offices in San Antonio, Texas.</string>
